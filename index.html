        <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can (28 ounces/800g) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 can (14 ounces/400g) tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste)</li>
        <li>/4 teaspoon black pepper (or to taste)</li>
        <li>2 cups (500g) ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups (200g) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (50g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>in a large skillet, cook the ground beef and Italian sausage over medium heat until browned. Break up the meat into crumbles as it cooks.<br> Drain any excess fat.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet and cook for another 2-3 minutes until the onion is translucent.</li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.<br> Simmer the sauce for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>While the sauce simmers, prepare the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese and half of the shredded mozzarella cheese. Mix well.</li>
        <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Place 3 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce, slightly overlapping them. Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles,<br> followed by a layer of the meat sauce. Repeat these layers until all the noodles are used, finishing with a layer of meat sauce on top. </li>
        <li>Sprinkle the remaining shredded mozzarella cheese and grated Parmesan cheese evenly over the top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with foil, ensuring it doesn't touch the cheese. Bake for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted, bubbly, and golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for 10-15 minutes before slicing.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves, if desired, and serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
